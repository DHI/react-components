# React Components

The React Components collection is a TypeScript based collection of components used across a range of application within DHI.

The intention with this library is include functionality rich components only and not so much shallow UI components.

A lot of the components in this library are oriented towards providing easy to use off the shelf components for Domain Services backends.

The components here will eventually either merge with the MIKE Shared UI components or at least be using the MIKE Shared UI components.

React-Components are demonstrated [here](https://domainservices.dhigroup.com/) and are available as npm package from Github packages.

## Getting started with development

The recommended workflow is to run TSDX in one terminal:

```
yarn
yarn start
```

To run Storybook

```
yarn
yarn start
yarn storybook
```

## Making alterations to React Components

Yalc can be used to test components as you build them within your own projects.

Generate a GitHub token (following guide at the top of this page under "Installation").

Run to install tools globally:
```
npm i rimraf -g
npm i yalc -g
```
Run command in react-components root folder:
```
RC-TS> yarn build
RC-TS> yalc push
# @dhi/react-components@0.2.63+ae197119 published in store.
```
Run command in project folder:
```
project> yarn remove @dhi/react-components
project> yalc add @dhi/react-components
# Package @dhi/react-components@0.2.63+ae197119 added ==> H:\dev\projects\SOPX\MarineAid.FrontEnd\node_modules\@dhi\react-components.
```

Every time you make a change to the react-component, just re-run `yalc push` and it will auto-update working project!

_Note_ Once you have completed your development, ensure you `yalc remove @dhi/react-components` publish the package to the web and run `yarn add react-components` to ensure you've wired up to the production (public) package.
